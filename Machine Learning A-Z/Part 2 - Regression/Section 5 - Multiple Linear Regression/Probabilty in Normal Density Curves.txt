Calculating shaded area
We can use the "normalcdf" function on most graphing calculators to find the shaded area:
 
​	  
normalcdf:
lower bound: 26
upper bound: 30
μ=26
σ=2
​	 
Output:
~ 0.4772



The calculator function "normalpdf" stands for normal probability density function. It finds the height of a normal curve at any given point.

The "normalcdf" function stands for normal cumulative density function, and it finds the area below a normal curve between two given points.
Since probability for a continuous random variable relates to shaded area under its density curve, we always use "normalcdf" to find probability when we're dealing with a normally distributed variable.


We could use the standard normal table and z-scores to find this probability, or we could use the 68-95-99.7% rule since the boundaries fall exactly at the mean and two standard deviation above the mean:
