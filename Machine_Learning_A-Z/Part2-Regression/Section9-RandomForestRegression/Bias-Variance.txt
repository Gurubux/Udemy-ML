Bias-Variance
Bias 	 : The inability of a Machine Learning algorithm (like linear Regression) to capture the true relationship
Variance : The difference in the Fits between datasets
HIGH Bias LOW Variance Linear Regression - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gurubux/Udemy-ML/master/Machine_Learning_A-Z/Part2-Regression/Section9-RandomForestRegression/Bias_Variance-HighB-LowV.PNG
Low Bias HIGH Variance 					 - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gurubux/Udemy-ML/master/Machine_Learning_A-Z/Part2-Regression/Section9-RandomForestRegression/Bias_Variance-LowB-HighV.PNG

Ideal algorithm should find a sweet spot between the Bias and the Variance(simple and complicated models) (LOW BIAS and LOW VARIANCE :-) )
- By REGULARIZATION , BOOSTING and BAGGING

Types of REGULARIZATION
	L2 Ridge
	L1 Lasso
	Elastic-Net
	https://github.com/Gurubux/Udemy-ML/raw/master/Machine_Learning_A-Z/Part2-Regression/Section10-EvaluatingRegressionModelsPerformance/P14-Regularization.pdf
Types of BOOSTING
	AdaBoost, GradientTreeBoosting,XGBoost
	Decreases Bias

Types of BAGGING
	Boostrap AGGregation
	Random Forest,More trees
	Decreases Variance
