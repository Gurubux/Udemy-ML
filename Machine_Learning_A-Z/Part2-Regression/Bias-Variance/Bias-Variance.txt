Bias-Variance  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBBz3bI-aA
Bias 	 : The inability of a Machine Learning algorithm (like linear Regression) to capture the true relationship
Variance : The difference in the Fits between datasets

HIGH Bias LOW Variance Linear Regression - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gurubux/Udemy-ML/master/Machine_Learning_A-Z/Part2-Regression/Section9-RandomForestRegression/Bias_Variance-HighB-LowV.PNG
Low Bias HIGH Variance 					 - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gurubux/Udemy-ML/master/Machine_Learning_A-Z/Part2-Regression/Section9-RandomForestRegression/Bias_Variance-LowB-HighV.PNG


Ideal algorithm should find a sweet spot between the Bias and the Variance(simple and complicated models) (LOW BIAS and LOW VARIANCE :-) )
- By REGULARIZATION , BOOSTING and BAGGING

Types of REGULARIZATION
	L2 Ridge 	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q81RR3yKn30&feature=youtu.be
	L1 Lasso 	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGf0voTMlcs&feature=youtu.be
	Elastic-Net - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dKRdX9bfIo&feature=youtu.be

Types of BOOSTING
	AdaBoost, GradientTreeBoosting,XGBoost
	Decreases Bias

Types of BAGGING
	Boostrap AGGregation
	Random Forest,More trees
	Decreases Variance


Learning Curves 
	To check if Training sample count improves Bias-Variance trade-off

	Learning curves – high bias and low variance
	Learning curves – low bias and high variance
